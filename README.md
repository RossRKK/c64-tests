# C64 Tests
I wanted to try writing some assembly programs in the Commodore 64

These were tested using the Vice emulator http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/

To build install the tpmx assembler https://style64.org/file/TMPx_v1.1.0-STYLE.zip

## Hello World

This folder just contains serveral different (but similar) ways to print "HELLO, WORLD!" to the screen.

I mainly used this to figure out differnet concepts like labels and sub-routines.
